OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

PROJECT :natural language processing (NLP) applications

OBJECTIVE

The objectives for natural language processing (NLP) applications are diverse, reflecting the broad scope of tasks and industries where NLP can be applied

KEY ACTIVITES

Text Tokenization:

Word Tokenization: Split text into individual words or tokens. This is the basic step for many NLP tasks.
Sentence Tokenization: Divide text into sentences, useful for tasks like summarization and machine translation.


3. Feature Extraction:
Bag of Words (BoW): Represent text as a collection of word counts or frequencies.
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Measure the importance of words relative to a document or corpus.
Word Embeddings: Convert words into dense vector representations (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT) to capture semantic meaning.


5. Model Training and Evaluation:
Training Models: Apply machine learning algorithms to train models on labeled data. Common models include logistic regression, support vector machines, and neural networks.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrices. Utilize cross-validation to ensure robustness.


6. Named Entity Recognition (NER):

Entity Extraction: Identify and classify entities in text (e.g., names, dates, locations) and categorize them into predefined classes.


8. Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:
POS Tagging: Assign parts of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to each word in a sentence to understand grammatical structure and meaning.

10. Dependency Parsing:
Parsing Sentences: Analyze the grammatical structure of sentences to determine relationships between words and their dependencies.

12. Sentiment Analysis:
Determining Sentiment: Analyze text to classify sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. Often involves understanding context and tone.
TECHNOLOGIES USED

PYTHON - Python: Widely used due to its rich ecosystem of libraries and tools for data analysis and modeling. Key libraries include:

scikit-learn: Provides a comprehensive suite of tools for building and evaluating linear regression models.

Statsmodels: Offers detailed statistical modeling, including linear regression with extensive diagnostic output.

Pandas: Useful for data manipulation and preparation.

NumPy: Provides support for numerical operations, which are fundamental in regression analysis.
